## Hello,
I am a fullstack developer so I'm proficient in the frontend and in the backend. When I think of coding, I see opportunity. I believe there is no area where solid code can't add tremendous value. This belief has led me into software Engineering. I may be new to software development, but I'm so excited to continue learning so that I can bring my ideas to life. Currently, I am working on an interactive drawing game.

# Thank you for stopping by!
