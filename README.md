## ðŸ‘‹ Hello,
When I think of coding, I envision opportunity. There is no area where solid code can't add tremendous value. This belief has led me to pursue Software Engineering. Dedicated to advancing my professional and technical skills, I am eager to learn and turn innovative ideas into reality. I am proficient in full-stack development, enabling me to create engaging, interactive frontends and robust, reliable backends. I desire to build web applications with greater scalability and resiliency, so I dedicate time to advancing my foundational knowledge of object-oriented principles.
## Thank you for stopping by!
